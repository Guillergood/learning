# ML Image Labeling

The easy way to use ML Kit for image labeling in Flutter.

With ML Kit's image labeling we can detect and extract information about entities in an image across a broad group of categories. The default image labeling model can identify general objects, places, activities, animal species, products, and more.

Note that this is intended for image classification models that describe the full image. For classifying one or more objects in an image, such as shoes or pieces of furniture, plugin `learning_object_detection` may be a better fit.
